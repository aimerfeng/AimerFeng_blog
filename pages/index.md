Hey! I'm AimerFeng (然然), a passionate Web3 and AI developer.

Exploring the intersection of {Blockchain} {Smart Contracts} {AI Agents}<br>
Building with {Ethereum} {Solidity} {Python} {TypeScript}<br>
Interested in {DeFi} {NFT} {LLM} {Machine Learning}<br>

I'm fascinated by decentralized technologies and artificial intelligence. My passion lies in building innovative solutions that bridge Web3 and AI, creating tools and applications that push the boundaries of what's possible. You can find my [full projects list here](/projects).

I write [blog posts](/posts) about Web3, blockchain technology, smart contract development, AI agents, and large language models. Sharing knowledge and learning from the community is an important part of my journey.

I'm constantly exploring new technologies and experimenting with creative ideas. From smart contract development to AI-powered applications, I enjoy the process of turning concepts into reality.

Outside of coding, I'm interested in the philosophy of decentralization, the future of AI, and how these technologies can create a better world. I believe in open source and the power of community-driven innovation.
